A standard approach is to have brand color names like <code>primary</code>, <code>secondary</code>, <code>accent</code>, and state colors like <code>success</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>info</code>. In addition to some neutral color shades for the background, text, and border colors.
